# World_Weather_Analysis

# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to retrieve weather data using OpenWeather API. Then, from that weather data, create a custom travel map based on preferred minimum and maximum temperatures while on vacation using the Google API. Finally, using the Google Directions API, a Travel Itinerary Map was generated for 4 possible locations that were in close in enough vicinity to drive to.
